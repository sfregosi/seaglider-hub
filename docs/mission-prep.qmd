## Before shipment

## Day of launch

#### Key Info:

#### Supplies:
- Laptop with Putty, WinSCP, Matlab, text editor

#### Goals:
- Review self test files
- Prepare final cmdfile, targets, science file, pmar file, sg_calib_constants.m
- Clean up basestation
- Set up desktop file storage
- Set up Matlab download scripts 

#### Tasks: 

##### Review any pre-mission self test files

- Look for critical errors, check parameters that need to be changed



##### Clean up basestation
- Connect to the basestation via WinSCP to view current status of basestation files
- If old files are on there, need to clean them up!
- Create a subdirectory within that gliderâ€™s folder. Name based on date, mission, or selftests
- Move all old data in one step
  - Open terminal window to basestation and login with password
  - Navigate to main directory by typing `cd /` and hitting *enter*
  - Type `usr/local/basestation/MoveData.py -m <current data location> -t <new data location>` into the terminal windown and hit *enter*
    - `<current location>` is usually `/home/sgxxx`
    - `<new location>` should be `/home/sgxxx/YYYY-MM-DD_deployment_location`
(i.e., `/home/sg607/2023-04-25_deployment_MHI`)
    - some text will print confirming it worked, and now `/home/sgxxx` will be mostly cleaned up and ready for new mission
    - this script **does not** move wisper files (`ws0001az.x00`, etc) and so those must be moved manually

##### Upload final piloting files
- [ ] Sg_calib_constants.m	
  - Change mission name
  - Check water density and mass
  - Check calibration constants
  - Check hydrodynamic params
- [ ] Upload `cmdfile`
  - Check all params and updated where needed for first short dive
- [ ] Check `.pagers`
- [ ] Check `pmar.cnf` (if PMAR system only)
- [ ] Check `science`
- [ ] Check `pdoscmds.bat`
  - Shouldn't need one to start a mission


##### Set up Matlab download script
- Check for agate updates
- Create download script
- Create folder structure on piloting computer


#### Issues
